# Cross-Platform Development Note

Use **standard C++ features whenever possible** to ensure the program runs consistently across **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**.

## When to Use Preprocessor Guards

Use **preprocessor guards** (`#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#if defined(...)`, etc.) **only when platform-dependent functionality is necessary** such as:

- Including OS-specific headers (e.g., `<windows.h>`)
- Executing system commands (`cls` vs `clear`)
- Handling compiler-specific options or optimizations
- Managing file paths or environment variables that differ between systems

# Branch Overview

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important  
Do **NOT** push directly to the `main` or `dev` branches.  
All changes should be committed to your personal branch first then merged via pull request.

| Branch | Belongs to                  | Description                                                                  |
|:-------|:----------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `main` | -                           | Stable branch containing the final and reviewed code                         |
| `dev`  | -                           | Development branch used for integration and testing before merging to `main` |
| `sp`   | Elysha Sophia binti Ridzuan | Use `git checkout sp` to switch                                              |
| `pr`   | Hew Pik Rou                 | Use `git checkout pr` to switch                                              |
| `wh`   | Lai Wei Heng                | Use `git checkout wh` to switch                                              |
| `wl`   | Low Wei Ling                | Use `git checkout wl` to switch                                              |

## Additional Notes
- ‚úÖ Push your commits often ‚Äî this prevents bugs, merge conflicts and compilation issues later.
- üîÑ Pull frequently to stay up-to-date with others‚Äô changes.
- ‚öôÔ∏è If you have uncommitted changes but need to pull:
```bash
git stash
git pull <branch> # Usually from the main branch
git stash apply 
```

# How to Build and Run

## Command-Line

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
mkdir build
cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build
./build/main_app
```

**Windows**
```bash
mkdir build
cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build --config Release
./build/Release/main_app.exe
```

## IDE

1.  Open the project's root folder in a CMake-compatible IDE (e.g., CLion, VS Code with CMake Tools, Visual Studio).
2.  Select `main_app` as the target.
3.  Click the "Run" button.
